# Built with üèó Scaffold-ETH 2

AskaS is proof-of-concept for a usecase of ERC-4907 rentable NFTs, which in this project we're using them for gating creator's content under a monthly paywall for users. Creators can choose a custom monthly rate that subscribers will have to pay. For now, the gated content consists of text articles.
